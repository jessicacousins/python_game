# Python Game - Heads or Tails

## Description:

A simple Python console app where the user can choose from two options (Heads or Tails) for a chance to win a random flip. When the user runs the game, it will display a welcome message and prompt to choose between Heads (H) or Tails (T). After making a choice, the game will simulate a coin flip and reveal if the user is the winner of the coin flip.
